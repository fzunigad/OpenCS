# Open CS

My path going through OpenCS (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

## Description

In here I will store all the exercises I made in my journey to complete 
the curriculum made by the folks of the Open Source Society University (link to their github above)

## Acknowledgments

* The awesome people at OSSU for making an excellent curriculum with free courses 
  and recommended books (some content paid but only if really helpful)
